To implement interface we have three ways->
1] Using class implementation
2] using anonymous class
3] using lambda expression

Lambda expression only used with functional interfaces.
functional interfaces can only have single abstract method to call itself functional.
Lambda expression its just used to give method implementation.

Syntax->
ReferenceInterface refName = () -> {
//method implementation
};

() : it represents empty method
(int a) : represents parameterised method
-> : arrow operator used to connect arguments with function body
